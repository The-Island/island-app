Now you can see detailed weather data for your climbing sessions on The Island. The more specific you are about when your efforts* happened, the more specific your data will be.

[Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) is really fun to work with. For any given time and location, [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) will return a daily summary and a 24 hour hourly forecast beginning at the specified time. For sessions, The Island reports daily values for temperature, dew point, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, and the type and intensity of precipitation. For specific efforts, you'll see weighted hourly values if the time of day is provided.

We can do so much with weather! For now, we'll just report a few values. Understanding and making good use of weather in rock climbing is crucial to performance.

Last winter, I spent a few weeks bouldering around Tennessee. I met some great people and climbed some of the best boulder problems I've ever seen. For the most part, the weather was great: very cold, windy, and sunny or just slightly overcast. On January 25th, the day I managed to scrape my way up the sandstone slab called Space at LRC, it was just above freezing and breezy.

I tried Barn Door again that day as well. Unfortunately, the good conditions were not enough for that one!

Enjoy the winter.

Cheers,

\* On The Island, you can log a completed climb, called an "ascent", or just some time spent working on a route / boulder problem, which we are calling "work". These are both more generally referred to as "efforts":

A "session" is defined by one or more "efforts" on the same day at a certain crag, as seen above.
