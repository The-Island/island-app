# Islandio

## Dependencies
Install the following system dependencies before running the Islandio application.

1) [Mongodb] version >= 2.4.6

2) [Nodejs] version >= 0.10.19

3) [NPM] version >= 1.3.11


#### Requirements
Once system dependencies are installed, go ahead and install the package dependencies. This can either be done by installing locally (into node_modules directory of the Islandio application) or globally with the `-g` flag. We'll install them locally as follows. From the root of the application run the following to install the application dependencies:

	$ npm install


#### Running
Be sure to boot up a valid Mongodb server running on default port of 27017. Start the application:

	$ node main.js


## Running tests
