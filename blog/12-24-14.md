Crag and ascent pages now have mini-Instagram feeds in addition to their main activity feeds.

Good stuff comes through for most crags. Climbers definitely love Instagram :) There's less for most ascents, but those with unique names do okay.

Lots of ascents don't show any climbing content. Instead, you may learn something about the origin of the climb's name!
