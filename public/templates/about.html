    <strong>Island</strong> is sort of a group blog with content cultivated by some of the world's best climbers. Our core Island Team is nearly 80 athletes strong.



<br><br>



In the latest release, we've shifted our focus to mapping in an effort to provide features that are useful to everyone. We're interested in real-time questions like, <em>"Who's climbing where and what"?</em> and <em>"Where are the best climbing conditions"?</em>, and on-going ones like <em>"What's the best photo or video of this climb"?</em> 

<br><br>

<strong>It's all about the Island Map.</strong>


<br><br>



<em>What we did</em> -

<br><br>

We've built a map with most of the world's crags. The Island Team can use their Instagram service (#island) to post images from the field that will appear on the Island Map. This feature will soon be open to all members.



<br><br>



<em>What we're doing</em> -

<br><br>

Our nerds are in their caves working on linking past and future media to the Island Map, crag check-ins, ascent tracking, a top-secret climbing condition index, media ranking with voting, and world peace to boot.



<br><br>



We love maps. Stay tuned for our updates. Many thanks to our friends over at <a href="https://cartodb.com/" target="_blank">CartoDB</a> (I'm looking at you <a href="/pkhcwqtb" class="navigate">Andrew W Hill</a>).
