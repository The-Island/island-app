Crag and ascent pages now have mini-Instagram feeds in addition to their main activity feeds.

Loads of climbing content comes through for most crags. Instagram is definitely the official medium of rock climbing. There will be less for most ascents, but those with unique names do okay.

A lot of ascents don't show any climbing related content at all. Instead, you may learn something about the origin of the climb's name.
