Now you can see detailed weather data for your climbing sessions on The Island. The more specific you are about when your efforts* happened, the more specific your data will be.

These days, [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) provides the cleanest and most developer friendly [source](https://developer.forecast.io/) of weather data. For any given time and location, [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io/) will return a daily summary, and a reality-corrected 24 hour hourly forecast beginning at the specified time. For sessions, The Island reports daily values for temperature, dew point, humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, and the type and intensity of precipitation. For specific efforts, you'll see weighted hourly values if the time of day is provided.

It's easy to get carried away with this. We can do so much with weather! For now, The Island is content with reporting a few values. After all, understanding and making good use of weather in rock climbing is just so crucial to performance.

Last winter, I spent a few weeks bouldering around Tennessee. I met some great people and climbed some of the best boulder problems I've ever seen. For the most part, the weather was great: very cold, windy, and sunny or just slightly overcast. On January 25th, the day I managed to drag my body up Space at LRC, it was just above freezing and real breezy!

I had my last session on Barn Door that day as well. Unfortunately, the good conditions were not enough for that one!

Enjoy the winter.

Cheers,

\* On The Island, you can log a completed climb, called an "ascent", or just some time spent working on a route / boulder problem, which we are calling "work". These are both more generally referred to as "efforts". This structure allows us to maintain a clean URL scheme:

```
www.island.io/efforts/{uid}
```

A "session" is defined by one or more "efforts" on the same day at a certain crag, as seen above.

```
www.island.io/sessions/{uid}
```
